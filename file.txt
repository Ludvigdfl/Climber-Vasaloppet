In the last seven days, a total of 1,693 business opportunity emails were received. Among these, 74 emails were classified with a high relevance score of 4 or 5, representing approximately 4% of the total emails. This highlights a modest volume of highly relevant opportunities within the incoming communications.

Looking at daily trends, the email distribution showed varied levels of activity. Some days experienced spikes in total emails received, which resulted in higher counts of relevant emails. However, several days recorded low activity, suggesting fluctuating engagement or interest from potential leads.

Finally, the data indicates that emails are being sent from a total of 7 unique senders. This suggests a concentrated source of opportunity emails, which may warrant further investigation to optimize outreach or follow-up strategies. Overall, while the total incoming emails are substantial, the percentage of high-relevance opportunities remains relatively low.
