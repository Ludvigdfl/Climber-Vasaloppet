**Today's date is March 25, 2025, which is a Tuesday.**

In the past week, a total of **1,693** incoming business opportunity emails were recorded. Out of these, only **74 emails**, or approximately **4%**, were classified as highly relevant (scores of 4 and 5). This indicates a concerning quality ratio, suggesting that most incoming communications may not be aligned with business objectives.

Throughout the week, email activity showed fluctuations but remained steady overall. The highest volume of emails appears to correlate with earlier dates in the week. The number of senders was notably low, with only **7 distinct senders** contributing to this volume. This might imply reliance on a small number of sources for potential opportunities, which could warrant further evaluation to diversify incoming leads.
