Welcome to today’s update for Tuesday, March 25, 2025. Here’s a brief summary of the insights regarding our incoming business opportunity emails over the past week.

In total, we received 146 emails in the last seven days. Out of these, only 10 emails, or approximately 7%, were categorized as high relevance (scores of 4 and 5). This indicates that while the volume of incoming communications is high, only a small portion is highly relevant to our consultancy. The trends indicate that although there were several days with good overall email counts, the last few days saw a notable drop, with only 4 emails received on March 22 and just 1 on March 23.

The data reflects the engagement from 4 different senders, suggesting our opportunities are somewhat scattered across a limited number of sources. This points to a need for further outreach or marketing strategies to boost the quality and relevance of the business opportunities coming our way. The current figures indicate an urgent necessity to refine our targeting processes to improve the relevance of incoming inquiries.
