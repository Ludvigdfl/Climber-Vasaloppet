Welcome to today's update for Tuesday, March 25, 2025. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key trends observed over the last week regarding incoming business opportunity emails for our consultancy firm.

In total, there were **146 emails** received this past week. Of these, only **10 emails**, representing **7%** of the total, were deemed highly relevant (scoring a 4 or 5 in relevance). This suggests that the majority of incoming opportunities may not align closely with our consultancy's objectives.

Daily email counts fluctuated throughout the week, with the highest volume recorded on March 17, totaling **33 emails**. The numbers remained pretty stable between **26 to 28 emails** for several days after, but dropped significantly to only **4 emails** on March 22 and just **1 email** on March 23. This downward trend in emails is concerning and prompts a potential review of our outreach strategies.

Finally, the communications originated from a total of **4 unique senders**, indicating limited diversity in our incoming opportunities. Strengthening relationships or broadening our outreach efforts may be necessary to boost both the volume and quality of leads moving forward.
