**Welcome to today's update on business opportunity emails for Tuesday, March 25, 2025.**

In the last seven days, a total of 146 emails related to business opportunities were received. Out of these, only 10 emails were categorized as highly relevant, scoring between 4 and 5. This translates to a 7% rate of high-relevance emails compared to the total. The volume of emails varied throughout the week, with the highest number received on March 17 at 33 emails, followed by 28 on March 19. The week saw a slight decline mid-week, with the lowest number being just 1 email on March 23.

There's notable consistency in lower relevance scores from 1 to 3, contributing the majority of the total emails. The total number of distinct senders was recorded at 4, indicating a concentrated interest from a few sources. This concentrated sender engagement alongside the low percentage of high-relevance emails suggests a need for refinement in targeting or a potential gap in outreach efforts.
