Welcome to today’s update! It’s Tuesday, March 25, 2025. Here’s a concise overview of the latest trends regarding incoming business opportunity emails over the past week.

In total, we received **146 emails** over the last seven days. Among these, there were **10 emails marked as highly relevant** with a score of 4 or 5, representing only **7%** of the total incoming emails. This indicates a relatively low conversion rate of opportunities deemed highly relevant compared to the overall volume.

Looking at daily activity, the highest volume of emails was on **March 17**, with **33 emails** received that day, showing a consistent interest in our services. The numbers gradually decreased over the following days, with **only 4 emails** received on **March 22** and just **1 email** on **March 23**. The total number of senders across this period was **4**, indicating a limited number of sources contributing to our email pool, which may suggest a narrow outreach potential or a focused niche in leads.

In summary, while the email volume peaked early in the week, the overall quality of high-relevance opportunities remains low, suggesting a need for strategic adjustments in targeting or outreach efforts.
