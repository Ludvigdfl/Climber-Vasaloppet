Over the past seven days, there has been a notable fluctuation in the volume of business opportunity emails received. The peak was observed on March 13, with 35 emails recorded, followed by another significant day on March 14, which saw 30 emails. There was a substantial drop in email volume on March 15, with only 1 email, and minimal activity continued through March 17 and 18, also recording just 1 email each day.

Analyzing the relevance of these emails, only a small portion were highly relevant, classified as 4 or 5 on the relevance scale. Specifically, just 7 emails, or approximately 5% of the total, were rated with the highest relevance. The distribution of senders indicates that there were 4 unique senders throughout the week, suggesting limited diversity in email sources.

Overall, while the week began with strong engagement, the latter part of the week showed significant decreases in both volume and relevance of the incoming emails, indicating a potential area for improvement in outreach or lead generation strategies moving forward.
